**DeSwarm DeFAI Vaults** are AI-driven, yield-generating pools that maximize returns by dynamically allocating liquidity across Berachain protocols. Integrated with Berachain’s Proof of Liquidity, these vaults will serve as reward vaults, enabling users to earn `$BGT` coming from validators alongside optimized yields.

**How Does It Work?**

Berachain’s ecosystem leverages Proof of Liquidity to offer attractive yields through staking LP tokens or farming under specific conditions. However, achieving the highest yield often requires users to execute multiple transactions and manually manage reward collection for compounding. DeSwarm simplifies this process by:

- Identifying the most profitable sequence of DeFi trades at any given time
- Allowing users to deposit into a single vault, which automatically executes the optimal strategy
- Collecting and compounding rewards on behalf of users

**AI-Driven Strategy Optimization**

- **Dynamic Liquidity Allocation**: Continuously reallocates funds across lending, staking, and yield farming protocols on Berachain to maximize APY
- **Risk Mitigation Mechanisms**: AI evaluates liquidity depth, protocol security, liquidation risk, and potential impermanent loss before executing transactions
- **Auto-Compounding**: Automatically reinvests earned yield to enhance returns

**Proof of Liquidity Integration**

DeSwarm DeFAI Vaults will be set up as reward vaults on Berachain, enabling users to earn `$BGT` emissions from validator nodes. By staking in these vaults, users not only benefit from AI-optimized yields but also receive `$BGT` rewards, which can be delegated to validators for additional incentives.

By using DeFAI Vaults, users gain access to AI-enhanced DeFi strategies without the need for active management, all while participating in Berachain’s PoL ecosystem.
