**DeSwarm DeFAI Vaults** are AI-driven, yield-generating pools that maximize returns by dynamically allocating liquidity across multiple protocols. 

**How Does It Work?**

Achieving the highest yield often requires users to execute multiple transactions and manually manage reward collection for compounding. DeSwarm simplifies this process by:

- Identifying the most profitable sequence of DeFi trades at any given time
- Allowing users to deposit into a single vault, which automatically executes the optimal strategy
- Collecting and compounding rewards on behalf of users

**AI-Driven Strategy Optimization**

- **Dynamic Liquidity Allocation**: Continuously reallocates funds across lending, staking, and yield farming protocols to maximize APY
- **Risk Mitigation Mechanisms**: AI evaluates liquidity depth, protocol security, liquidation risk, and potential impermanent loss before executing transactions
- **Auto-Compounding**: Automatically reinvests earned yield to enhance returns
