## DeFAI Vaults

**DeFAI Vaults** are yield-generating pools that leverage AI-driven strategies and DeFi integrations to maximize returns for users. These vaults dynamically allocate liquidity across various protocols, ensuring optimal yield based on market conditions.

### Vault Types

1. **ETH Vault** – Focused on Ethereum mainnet and L2 yield opportunities
2. **BTC Vault** – Designed for Bitcoin-based DeFi strategies
3. **Stablecoin Vault** – Ensures stable yield generation with minimal volatility

### AI-Driven Strategy Optimization

- **Dynamic Liquidity Allocation**: QUEEN continuously reallocates funds across lending, staking, and yield farming protocols to optimize APY
- **Risk Mitigation Mechanisms**: AI evaluates liquidity depth, protocol security, liquidation risk and potential impermanent loss before executing transactions

By leveraging DeFAI Vaults, users gain access to professionally managed, AI-enhanced DeFi investment strategies without requiring active management.

QUEEN will leverage DeFi strategies, flipping liquidity between protocols to maximize APY.
