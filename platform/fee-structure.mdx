The DeSwarm platform generates fees from the Perpetual DEX and DeFAI Vaults, which are utilized to enhance rewards for $DSM stakers and support Berachainâ€™s Proof of Liquidity ecosystem.

- **Perpetual DEX Fees**: A small percentage of each trade (e.g., 0.1% maker/taker fee) is collected. These fees are split between validator incentives (to direct $BGT emissions to DeSwarm vaults) and $DSM buybacks
- **DeFAI Vault Fees**: A performance fee (10%) is charged on yields generated in the vaults. These fees are similarly allocated to validator incentives and $DSM buybacks.
- **Transparency**: All fees are clearly displayed in the platform interface, with a portion reinvested into the ecosystem
