The DeSwarm platform generates fees from the DeFAI Vaults, which are utilized to enhance rewards for $DSM stakers.

- **DeFAI Vault Fees**: A performance fee (10%) is charged on yields generated in the vaults. These fees are similarly allocated to $DSM buybacks
- **Transparency**: All fees are clearly displayed in the platform interface, with a portion reinvested into the ecosystem
