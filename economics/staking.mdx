Staking `$DSM` is a core mechanism within the DeSwarm ecosystem, designed to enhance yield opportunities and provide exclusive benefits for participants within Berachainâ€™s Proof of Liquidity scheme.

**Staking Benefits**

- **Boosted Yield**: Stakers receive enhanced rewards from DeFAI Vaults, optimizing their returns on deposited assets
- **Perps & Vaults Fees**: Stakers directly benefit from fees generated by the Perpetual DEX and DeFAI Vaults, which are used to buy `$DSM` for distribution
- **`$BGT` Rewards**: Stakers earn `$BGT` through DeFAI Vaults (as reward vaults)
- **DeSwarm DeFAI Terminal**: At a later stage, the terminal will be available only to `$DSM` stakers, providing exclusive access to AI-driven insights
