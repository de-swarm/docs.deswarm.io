DeSwarm integrates with Berachain’s Proof of Liquidity (PoL) to enhance rewards for $DSM stakers and align incentives across the ecosystem. PoL is a consensus mechanism that rewards liquidity provision, using $BGT (Berachain Governance Token) to incentivize users and protocols.

**Integration Overview**

DeSwarm’s DeFAI Vaults will be set up as reward vaults on Berachain, allowing users to stake assets and earn $BGT emissions from validator nodes. The platform uses fees generated from the Perpetual DEX and DeFAI Vaults to incentivize validators, ensuring a steady flow of $BGT to its vaults. This integration creates a flywheel where $DSM stakers benefit from both AI-optimized yields and Berachain’s PoL rewards.

**How It Works**

1. **Reward Vault Setup**:
    - DeSwarm DeFAI Vaults are whitelisted as reward vaults on Berachain, enabling users to stake assets (e.g., LP tokens or other PoL-eligible tokens) and earn $BGT
    - The AI optimizes vault strategies to maximize yield while users simultaneously earn $BGT proportional to their stake
2. **Validator Incentives**:
    - DeSwarm allocates a portion of its platform fees (from the Perpetual DEX and DeFAI Vaults) to incentivize validator nodes
    - Validators, in return, direct their $BGT emissions to DeSwarm’s reward vaults, increasing the $BGT rewards available to vault depositors
3. **Fee Utilization**:
    - Platform fees are also used to buy $DSM from the market, which is then distributed to vaults and stakers, enhancing their rewards beyond vault yields
    - This dual mechanism ensures $DSM stakers benefit from both DeSwarm’s AI-driven strategies and Berachain’s PoL ecosystem

**Benefits for $DSM Stakers**

- **Enhanced Rewards**: Stakers earn $BGT from validator emissions, in addition to vault yields
- **Fee Sharing**: A portion of platform fees is used to acquire $DSM, directly benefiting stakers
- **Ecosystem Alignment**: By participating in PoL, $DSM stakers contribute to Berachain’s liquidity and security, aligning their interests with the broader ecosystem

This integration positions DeSwarm in Berachain’s ecosystem as a project leveraging AI to optimize DeFi strategies while enhancing user rewards through PoL.
