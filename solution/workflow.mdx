Two-layer architecture:

1. Autonomous layer: Market data processing → Risk assessment → Deposit execution
2. User layer: NLP command processing → Deposit validation → On-chain execution

Each fund runs on an isolated agent instance to prevent security vulnerabilities. Strict 1:1 mapping between agents and managed funds.

### **Queen Agent**

Distributed AI system executing trades based on market analysis. Operates either autonomously within pre-set risk parameters or via user commands. Uses multi-agent validation for trade execution.

### **Queen Terminal**

Token-gated interface for direct agent interaction. Users input strategies in natural language, which get parsed into executable on-chain transactions or recommendations. All operations require wallet signature confirmation.
