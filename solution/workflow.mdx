The significant infrastructure disparity between agent theoretical capabilities and practical implementation for yield optimization necessitates a purpose-built solution addressing the complexities of automated financial operations in dynamic market environments. While existing infrastructure provides robust transaction execution mechanisms, it lacks the specialized capabilities required for secure, scalable, and user-friendly agent operations which are focused on multiple protocols at the same time. DeSwarm has developed the essential infrastructure to maximize the potential of Berachain’s Proof of Liquidity (PoL) protocol.

DeSwarm effectively bridges the divide between conceptual agent capabilities and their practical implementation for yield optimization. The protocol leverages Berachain’s Proof of Liquidity (PoL) to enable users to effortlessly create and manage diversified yield portfolios.

The DeSwarm protocol operates on a sophisticated two-layer architectural foundation:

1. Terminal Layer: Provides the foundational infrastructure for agent operations
2. Execution Layer: Handles transaction execution and portfolio management

Each vault operates on an isolated agent instance, maintaining a strict 1:1 mapping between agents and managed vaults to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure operational integrity.

### **Terminal Workflow**

The Terminal component functions as a sophisticated market analysis system providing comprehensive insights and data visualization for the Berachain DeFi ecosystem. It serves as an advanced search engine for market sentiment and yield opportunities without executing trades directly.

### **Vault Workflow**

The Vault component enables automated portfolio management through advanced agent operations. Users can interact with the platform to define investment strategies, which are then implemented by the protocol within predetermined parameters. All operations require wallet signature confirmation to maintain security and user control.
