The significant infrastructure disparity between agent theoretical capabilities and practical implementation for yield optimization necessitates a purpose-built solution addressing the complexities of automated financial operations in dynamic market environments. While existing infrastructure provides robust transaction execution mechanisms, it lacks the specialized capabilities required for secure, scalable, and user-friendly agent operations which are focused on multiple protocols at the same time. DeSwarm has developed the essential infrastructure to maximize the potential of DeFi.

DeSwarm effectively bridges the divide between conceptual agent capabilities and their practical implementation for yield optimization. 

The DeSwarm protocol operates on a sophisticated two-layer architectural foundation:

1. Terminal Layer: Provides the foundational infrastructure for agent operations
2. Execution Layer: Handles transaction execution and portfolio management

Each vault operates on an isolated agent instance, maintaining a strict 1:1 mapping between agents and managed vaults to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure operational integrity.

### **Agentic Workflow**

Two-layer architecture:

1. Autonomous layer: Market data processing → Risk assessment → Deposit execution
2. User layer: NLP command processing → Deposit validation → On-chain execution

Each vault runs on an isolated agent instance to prevent security vulnerabilities. Strict 1:1 mapping between agents and managed funds.

Distributed AI system executing trades based on market analysis. Operates either autonomously within pre-set risk parameters or via user commands. Uses multi-agent validation for trade execution.

### **Terminal Workflow**

Interface for direct agent interaction. Users input prompts in natural language, which get parsed into executable recommendations. All operations require wallet signature confirmation.
