**Data Swarm**

Distributed data ingestion system. Pulls from on-chain state, DEX events, oracle feeds, and external APIs. Normalizes data for analytical processing.

**Analytics Swarm**

ML pipeline for market analysis. Runs pattern recognition on price action, liquidity metrics, and cross-chain activity. Outputs trade signals with confidence scores.

**Confirmation Swarm Layer**

Distributed validation network. Multiple agents run independent verification on proposed trades. Each agent accesses different data sources and applies unique risk models. Minimum consensus required for execution.

**On-chain Actions**

Smart contract integration layer. Interfaces with DEX aggregators, lending protocols, and yield platforms. Executes atomic transactions for complex trading strategies. Supports cross-chain operations through bridge protocols.
