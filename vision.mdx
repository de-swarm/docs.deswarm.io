In the rapidly evolving world of crypto, where AI is driving increasingly automated decision-making, DeSwarm aims to empower users by simplifying and optimizing DeFi strategies. Many crypto users understand DeFi mechanics and are aware of high-yield opportunities but fail to capitalize on them due to time constraints, the complexity of managing multiple transactions, or the volatility of short-term APYs.

Many chains offers attractive yield opportunities but often requires users to execute numerous transactions to fully optimize their strategies. DeSwarm addresses this challenge by leveraging AI to streamline yield optimization, enabling users to search for the best DeFi opportunities, deploy liquidity into automated vaults, and trade perpetuals, all within a single platform.

Our mission is to harness AI to short-circuit the capabilities of users already in the space, helping them unlock DeFi full potential without the need for constant manual intervention.
