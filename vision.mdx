Imagine a future where finance is not only decentralized but also intelligentâ€”where AI transcends the limitations of yield farming and fund management. In this vision, **On-chain DeFAI Funds** emerge as a groundbreaking innovation in the crypto landscape.

In the fast-evolving world of crypto, driven by advancements in AI, decision-making will become increasingly automated, powered by AI agents with defined roles and guidelines, mirroring the structure of traditional models.

There are a lot of crypto users who understand how DeFi works and see a lot of high yield opportunities that they don't take advantage of for a number of reasons, usually it's lack of time to monitor positions and a non-sustainable high APY that will drop very quickly.

We believe that one of the best use cases for AI x crypto is to optimize the yield and short-circuit the capabilities of users who are already in crypto but have not used it to its full potential.

At DeSwarm, we aim to take this evolution a step further. Our mission is to empower users to create their own AI-driven on-chain funds, where AI agents operate with personalized guidelines tailored to their specific roles. These agents will seamlessly interact with DeFi protocols, unlocking new levels of autonomy in the investment process.
